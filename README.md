# AI-Virtual-Paint
## Abstract
Virtual painting is an innovative technology that has been developed in recent years to provide a 
new and engaging way of creating and experiencing art. It involves the use of digital tools and 
techniques to simulate the process of painting in a virtual environment, allowing users to create 
artworks in a way that is both intuitive and expressive. This mini project explores the concept of 
virtual painting and its implementation using digital image processing techniques. The project 
focuses on developing an interactive system that enables users to create virtual paintings using a 
variety of digital tools such as brushes, colours, textures and eraser. It offers a range of benefits 
such as eliminating the need for physical paint and canvas, making it a more environmentally 
friendly option, and providing artists with greater flexibility and control over their creative process.
